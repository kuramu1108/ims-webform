SCENARIO ENET Care is a charitable organization. The charity aims to improve housing and sanitation for 
             remote communities and the long-term homeless.  <br />
<br />
ENET Care employs staff who visit needy communities and provide evidence-based interventions.
             The interventions include education, low-cost housing, portable toilets, mosquito nets, tents and firstaid kits. <br />

<br />
Funding comes from a range of sources: government contracts, government grants, corporate 
             sponsorship and public donations. Evidence of progress and success is an important
             factor in renewing funding. <br />

<br />
ENET Care is considering building an information system (an ‘Intervention Monitoring System’) 
             to gather data on the success of their efforts. This data will be used to generate 
             reports for sponsors. In addition, ENET Care plans to eventually use the data to improve
             its internal decision-making by analysing the effectiveness of its interventions. <br />

<br />

When it comes to building software systems, ENET Care uses a two-stage process. First, they 
             implement a proof of concept to test the idea. If the system is a success, then 
             they approve the implementation of a production-ready system. They have standardized 
             on the .NET platform: proofof-concepts are to be implemented using ASP.NET WebForms 
             and ADO.NET; approved systems are then re-implemented for production using ASP.NET MVC
             and Entity Framework. <br />

<br />
The charity has a culture of minimizing administrative costs so it is important that the 
             productionready system be easy to use <br />
